   <h2>If you're gonna get wings, don't be basic</h2>

   <p>I’ve recently found myself in a rut. Been listening to the same hip-hop songs over and over. Eating at the same pizza joints. Using the same metaphors. Running the same code. Just going through the motions, get my drift? 
</p>
<p>Predictability can be comforting - it’s why tourists travel to New York and hit up Starbucks for coffee and McDonalds for lunch, rather than dip their toes (and tongues) into one of the city’s more esoteric eateries. 

</p>  
<p>But as Bob Dylan said, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHGrWTmXK6w' target='blank' style={{color:'blue', fontSize:16}} >he not busy being born is busy dying</a>. And no one wants to be basic, right? I’m actually allergic to basic. So this weekend, I decided the first step to break out of my basic stasis would be a 12-set of Mango Habanero wings from Best Wingers in the Lower East Side. 
</p>

<p>I had seen Best Wingers on Uber Eats previously and assumed it was a bodega ghost kitchen - the name and price-point just screamed “frozen wings dumped in a fryer next to the deli meats” But upon visiting their<a href='https://bestwingers.com/' target='blank' style={{color:'blue',fontSize:16}}> website</a>, I realized this was a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint I pass all the time in the Lower East Side, located on the part of Delancey Street where the Williamsburg Bridge just starts to pick-up off the ground. Perusing Best Wingers’ menu, I was encouraged at the array of options - here was a proper wing spot, I thought, with multiple sauce-and-dry-rubs ranging from Memphis BBQ to Thai Chili to good ol’ buffalo sauces of varying heat levels. 
</p>
<p>	I was craving sweet, and of course I like ‘em hot, so the Mango Habanero seemed like the right fit for me. Eight wings is typically my happy place for portion control, but big-boy had run hard that morning, and so I had no qualms doubling my order to a 12-piece, in addition to adding a side of jalapeno cheddar poppers. Life of a don, ya’all.
</p>
<p>The food came in about a half hour, steaming hot in separate cardboard cartons. I opened up the jalapeno cheddar poppers first, which turned out to be lil’ deep-fried nuggets about the size of the top digit of my thumb. These were good, in the way fried food can always be good, but I didn’t taste any jalapeno or cheddar. Anodyne plugs of breaded-and-fried soylent, are what these tasted like.. 

</p>
<p> 
	Then, the chicken - the heft of the various wings, drumlets and flats were satisfactory. Too often, I’ve ordered wings that impressed in flavor but looked like they came from the skinniest, saddest chicken in the coop. Best Wingers’ chicken pieces, to their credit, were plump and juicy. They were also crispy, and gave back a nice crackle when I squeezed. As far as a flavor delivery system, Best Wingers’ knows how to fry some chicken.

</p>
<p>The Mango Habanero flavoring came as a dry rub; a few fingertip-licks confirmed this was a tasty, slightly hot and probably-sugary spice mix. The orange-brown sheen of the rub covered most chicken pieces, but I did sense right away there might not be enough over every piece. A few wings looked nearly-naked. 
</p>
<p>Actually eating the wings confirmed that the rub was a little skimpy in places; I had to wipe a few pieces across the bottom of the cardboard to pick up more spice, although the chicken’s plump-juiciness and crackly skin certainly held its own pleasures.</p>
<p>To me, what Best Wingers as a whole lacked in flavor, they made up for in proficiency with a deep-fryer - this goes for both the jalapeno poppers and the wings. I would order from Best Wingers again and mix-and-match different dry rubs, as well order a few extra sauces on the side to ensure I was equipped with the necessary weapons to blast my senses. 
</p>
<p>My score for Best Wingers: 3 out of 5 - uh, stars? Skulls? Prayer hands? I still need to figure out a rating system here. Whatever system I pick, just know it won’t be basic. I’m allergic to basic. Already said that, didn’t I? Until next time. </p>
