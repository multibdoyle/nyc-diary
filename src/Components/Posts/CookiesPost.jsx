      <h2>The 14 Best Cookies Below 14th Street in Manhattan</h2>
      <p>I have been blessed enough to try cookies at some places which have not gotten love from blogs - or Yelp - or any other best of lists I have seen but are original and baked-in-house and will blow the socks off every other cookie. </p>
      <p>Without further ado - the cookie ‘adoos!</p>
     <p><b>Fat Cat Kitchen</b> - A 14th street icon with salted chocolate chip cookies worth walking through East Village feeling like a porky little seven year old with chocolate on your face amid a sea of cool 20-somethings</p>
     <p><b>Cupcake Market</b> - These are like Levain Bakery, in that they are scone-sized and the entire thing is only slightly firmer than an unbaked ball of cookie dough. And they have a s’mores option. Get a cookie AND a cupcake for cheat day beast mode status. </p>
<p><b>Ben’s Cookies</b> - Straight out of Oxford, England, this Union Square cookie shoppe has one of my absolute favorite cookies ever made - dark-chocolate ginger - and has never not given me a hot, fresh cookie to savor. I salute you, sirs!</p>
<p><b>Posh Pop Bakeshop</b> - One of the best things I’ve eaten in the past 12 months was a brownie-stuffed funfetti cookie - something to that effect - which was extremely memorable for its soft brownie interior and somewhat crispy-sugary edges. Everything looks good at this gluten-free pink and a fruschia Greenwich Village Instagram favorite - but again, that brownie-stuffed cookie *Kisses and explodes fingertips*</p>
  <p><b>Gooey on the Inside</b> - Fat cookies stuffed with stuff - yeah, it’s a trend, but has there ever been a more worthwhile trend? This Lower East Side joint plays the game well as anyone. Plus, the people who own it are super nice. </p>
<p><b>Bak’d Bakery</b> - I had their eggnog-stuff ‘Home Alone’ cookie this past holiday season, walking home from the office holiday party, and wanted to shout to all of Broadway their excellence - like, grab a stranger, ‘Hey sir, have you tried Bak’d Bakery cookies? Their great!!’ The baker pays particular attention to detail in ingredients - for instance, the official description of the ‘Home Alone’ cookie was a ‘ginger molasses cookie base, mixed with cinnamon chips, graham cracker pieces and white chocolate chips. Then stuffed with an eggnog icing.’ Like...for real? </p>
<p> The founder is also a bodybuilder, which puts her in the same class of superhero-athlete-bakers as the Levain Bakery Ironman duo.
Now, technically, Bak’d is in hibernation mode, but they are set to launch nationwide early this year. You can stay abreast of their launch plans from their website.
</p>
<p><b>LA Burdick</b> - This Soho chocolate shop makes a deliciously decadent cookie which showcases dense discs of their tre-bougie chocolate - warmed up, this will make you audibly moan in pleasure while walking down the street. I know because it happened to me.</p>
<p><b>Sweet Rehab</b> - These cookies are slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and has the kind of sophisticated taste that’s been perfected over generations of French pastry art. I also happen to live next to this Soho bakery, and most mornings am greeted with the smell of warming butter and sugar after my morning run; not that I’m playing favorites with the neighbors. Go here, go nuts. 
</p>  
<p><b>Westbourne</b> - This Soho spot serves a wide, thinnish, soft, chewy specimen speckled dark-brown specimen, replete with chocolate discs that taste like high-end 99% pure-cacao. Pure money, is what I’m trying to say. 
</p>
<p><b>Gregory’s</b> - I’m shocked I’ve never seen, read or heard any mention of these cookies among the city’s greats. Soft and sophisticated and buttery and - did I mention sophisticated? Layers of flavor - layers of chocolate - if you’re anywhere in downtown Manhattan west of 3rd avenue, I would urge you to find your way to the nearest Gregory’s ASAP and load up on cookies. </p>
<p><b>For Five</b> - These are of the huge-stuffed-colorful-Instagram ready variety; many feature some variation of colorful stripes and / or sugary-buttery filling. And they are all delicious. </p>
<p><b>The Black Fox</b> - This Australian cafe in the Financial District has gotten accolades for it’s great coffee, vibe, general food selection, but I’ve never seen anyone call out the particular perfection of their soft salted chocolate chip cookies. Definitely worth getting a bit off the grid in the Financial District for a taste of these bad boys. </p>
  <p><b>Kaffe 1668</b> - I just don’t think people know you can get a soft homebaked high-quality cookie this close to the World Trade Center; and they should. They really should. 
</p>
<p> <b>The Woolly</b> - This cookie was hyped up for me by a girl at work; they were indeed soft and delicious and gently salty, much like its close FiDi neighbors Kaffe 1668 and The Black. Do what I did - if you’re truly committed - and hit up all three in one morning. </p>
