   <h2>Ghost Kitchens, Volume 1: Meet the Ghosts</h2>

   <p>More of my wallet has gone to online-delivery platforms since lockdown began. This, despite the well-documented fact that GrubHub, UberEats and their ilk all <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/30/uber-eats-offers-nyc-restaurants-a-break-on-fees/" target="_blank" style={{color: 'blue', fontSize:16}}> suck restaurant’s dry</a> with order processing, marketing and delivery commissions. </p>
   <p>Whatever. Big boy needs a cheeseburger on cheat day, and unfortunately, none of us are about to sit down at J.G. Mellon’s anytime soon.</p>
   <p>But, as with every crisis, there is opportunity, and the opportunity for many chefs to continue operating, testing and - I donno, not survive on a government check - has been found in virtual restaurants, a.k.a., ghost kitchens. 
 </p>
   <p>Ghost kitchens were buzzing even <a href='https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/why-ghost-restaurants-are-changing-the-delivery-game/546624/' target='blank' style={{color:'blue',fontSize:16}}>before quarantine</a>, as restaurateurs pored through UberEats search data to cook up delivery-only sub-brands catered to a neighborhood’s particular tastes. As ‘delivery-only’ has become a needless qualifier for restaurants in 2020, a natural consequence has been more companies licensing specific segments of their menus - or entirely new concepts - as their own option on delivery apps. </p>
   <p>Even Chuck E. Cheese got in on the ghost kitchen game, registering a Philadelphia pizza delivery company under the brand name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/g3xkfl/tried_to_support_local_business_via_grubhub/" target="_blank" style={{color: 'blue',fontSize:16}}> Chuck's Italian chef rock drummer.</a></p>
   <p>But the results are not all bad, and not all limited to weirdo corporate opportunism. </p>
  <p>Exhibit A: Free Bird, a ‘restaurant’ I found on UberEats relatively late one recent Saturday night when I was craving chicken wings. </p>
  <p>Mind you, I wasn’t looking for common flash-fried wings shoveled on top of fries, which seemed to be the most popular option at 9:30 p.m. on this particular night. I was about to watch a movie; I wanted a meal with a semblance of class. </p>
  <p>Free Bird right away caught my eye with a hero image of multi-colored wings - ranging from frosted white to angry red to pickled green. Clicking further, I was impressed to see Truffle Mac and Cheese and Seven Spiced Edamame on the menu, in addition to mixed wing sets.  </p>
  <p>I still have to perfect the art of food snaps, and I also lack the patience to take photos of my food before eating - but, take a gander at this menu shot of the Blue Cheese White Truffle babies:</p>
  <img style={{borderRadius:12, position:'relative'}} src='https://d1ralsognjng37.cloudfront.net/0abbb5e8-069f-4b2a-8d5a-3e1e3a7df6d3.jpeg' alt='wings' height='20%' width='20%' class='center' ></img>

  <p>That’s a fairly true-to-life depiction of the wings I actually ordered, which were crispy, juicy and coated with a blue-cheese-white-truffle goodness I never knew I needed. </p>
  <p>But that’s not all - Free Bird was stacked with desserts. To my delight, they actually had dessert ‘partners’ - Cookies by Crumb, Cakes by Amai Modern Cakes, in addition to what looked like their own ‘Dessert Creations in a Jar.’ My cup runneth over. </p>
  <p>At least one of these dessert partners - <a href='https://www.seamless.com/menu/crumb-cookie-74-5th-ave-new-york/2033827' target='blank' style={{color:'blue',fontSize:16}}> Crumb Cookie</a> - is another strictly virtual restaurant which has frequently popped up in my late-night quarantine sweet searches. </p>
  <p>Having already tried Crumb at least once (I’ll vouch their Oatmeal Apricot Cranberry cookie is very, very good), I instead opted for two of the more exotic options: a slice of Japanese cheesecake, and a chocolate lava cake. </p>
  <p>The desserts were great. Don’t press me for food adjectives, I’m going to run out quickly. </p>
  <p>Who are you, Free Bird? What are you? What kind of genius mind-reader (or search demand data literate) chefs worked on your menu to know I’d want both truffle mac and cheese AND a mind-bending variety of wing flavors AND a choice between Japanese cheesecake and Nutella sea salt cookies?  </p>
  <p>All I had was the name and the address - 74 5th Avenue. A quick Google Search revealed the kitchen location was the same as <a href='https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greenwich-social-new-york-4' target='blank' style={{color:'blue', fontSize:16}} >The Greenwich Social </a>, a cafeteria-style food hall near Union Square.  </p>
  <p>The very same address, in fact, as Crumb Cookies.</p>
  <p>Greenwich Social is Free Bird is Crumb. It was all a virtual dream. Somewhere in the land of ghost kitchens, smart minds recognized opportunity, spun up a few branded menus, and collaborated to create a seamless, delightful tasting experience for me, just a guy trying to find a balance between Momofuku and bodega chicken wings to pair with my Saturday night movie. </p>
  <p>Ghost kitchens: the way of the future. My future, at least. I’ve already got my eye on Frenchy Burger - a virtual joint which looks to be served out of hip brick-and-mortar Alphabet City spot <a href='https://www.pmfnyc.com/' target='blank' style={{color:'blue', fontSize: 16}}> Pardon My French </a>. And I would list more, but I guess that’s the point of ghost kitchens - you can rarely tell which are ghosts.
